for supabase migrations, use `supabase migrations new` rather than manually creating the file
my created_by fields reference public.users and not auth.users
NEVER change data in my remote database or apply migrations through the supabase MCP / psql / supabase db push. All changes should ONLY be done through my automated CICD unless I EXPLICITLY tell you otherise. Test migrations and changes locally first.
 
Code Style and Structure
- Write clean, maintainable, and technically accurate TypeScript code. - Prioritize functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid using
classes. - Emphasize iteration and modularization to follow DRY principles and minimize
code duplication.

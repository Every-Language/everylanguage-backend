# CI/CD Pipeline Documentation

This document explains how our automated CI/CD pipeline works, what it does, and how to use it effectively.

## üìã Overview

Our CI/CD pipeline consists of three main workflows:

1. **CI (Continuous Integration)** - Runs on every push and pull request
2. **Deploy** - Runs when code is merged to `main` branch
3. **Publish Types** - Automatically publishes NPM package when schema changes

## üîÑ CI Workflow (`ci.yml`)

### When It Runs

- Every push to `main` or `develop` branches
- Every pull request targeting `main` or `develop` branches
- Manually triggered from GitHub Actions tab

### What It Does

1. **Environment Setup**

   - Checks out your code
   - Sets up Node.js 18 with npm caching
   - Installs dependencies with `npm ci`

2. **Code Quality Checks**

   - **Linting**: Runs ESLint to check code style and catch errors
   - **Formatting**: Verifies Prettier formatting
   - **Type Checking**: Runs TypeScript compiler to catch type errors

3. **Database Testing**

   - Sets up Supabase CLI
   - Starts local Supabase instance
   - Waits for services to be ready
   - Runs all tests against local database

4. **Type Generation Verification**
   - Generates TypeScript types from current schema
   - Compares with committed types
   - Fails if types are out of date

### Example CI Run Output

```
‚úÖ Checkout code
‚úÖ Setup Node.js
‚úÖ Install dependencies
‚úÖ Run linting
‚úÖ Check formatting
‚úÖ Type check
‚úÖ Setup Supabase CLI
‚úÖ Start Supabase local development
‚úÖ Wait for Supabase to be ready
‚úÖ Run tests
‚úÖ Verify generated types are up to date
‚úÖ Stop Supabase
```

## üöÄ Deploy Workflow (`deploy.yml`)

### When It Runs

- Automatically when code is pushed to `main` branch
- Only after CI workflow passes
- Manually triggered from GitHub Actions tab

### What It Does

1. **Production Deployment**
   - Connects to production Supabase project
   - Applies database migrations
   - Deploys Edge Functions (if any exist)
   - Verifies production schema

## üì¶ Publish Types Workflow (`publish-types.yml`)

### When It Runs

- Automatically after successful deployment to `main`
- Manually triggered from GitHub Actions tab with version options
- Only when database schema changes are detected

### What It Does

1. **Type Generation & Publishing**
   - Generates TypeScript types from production database
   - Compares with previously published types
   - Automatically bumps version (patch/minor/major)
   - Publishes `@everylanguage/shared-types` to NPM
   - Creates GitHub release with version notes
   - Updates repository with new types

### Version Bumping Logic

- **Major (x.0.0)**: Breaking changes detected in commit messages (`BREAKING CHANGE`, `feat!`)
- **Minor (1.x.0)**: New features detected (`feat:` commits)
- **Patch (1.0.x)**: Bug fixes and other changes

### Manual Publishing

You can manually trigger type publishing:

1. Go to Actions tab ‚Üí "Publish Types Package"
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Choose version bump type (patch/minor/major)
4. Click "Run workflow"

### Deployment Process

```

## üõ†Ô∏è Developer Workflow

### Normal Development Process

1. **Create Feature Branch**

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature
   ```

2. **Make Changes**

   ```bash
   # Make your changes
   # Add tests
   # Update documentation if needed
   ```

3. **Test Locally**

   ```bash
   npm test                    # Run tests
   npm run lint               # Check linting
   npm run format:check       # Check formatting
   npm run type-check         # Check types
   ```

4. **Commit and Push**

   ```bash
   git add .
   npm run commit             # Use conventional commits
   git push origin feature/your-feature
   ```

5. **Create Pull Request**

   - Go to GitHub and create PR
   - CI automatically runs
   - Wait for green checkmarks ‚úÖ
   - Request review from team

6. **Address CI Failures (if any)**

   ```bash
   # If linting fails:
   npm run lint:fix

   # If formatting fails:
   npm run format

   # If types are outdated:
   npm run generate-types

   # Commit fixes and push
   git add .
   git commit -m "fix: resolve CI issues"
   git push
   ```

7. **Merge After Approval**
   - All CI checks pass ‚úÖ
   - Code review approved ‚úÖ
   - Merge to main
   - Deploy workflow runs automatically

### Working with Database Changes

#### Creating Migrations

```bash
# Create new migration
supabase migration new add_user_profiles

# Edit the migration file
# supabase/migrations/20241201000001_add_user_profiles.sql

# Test migration locally
npm run migrate

# Generate updated types
npm run generate-types

# Commit changes (include both migration and types)
git add supabase/migrations/ types/database.ts
npm run commit
```

#### Migration Best Practices

1. **Always test migrations locally first**
2. **Include both up and down migrations**
3. **Generate types after schema changes**
4. **Test that CI passes before requesting review**
5. **Use conventional commits for proper version bumping**:
   - `feat:` for new tables/columns ‚Üí Minor version bump
   - `fix:` for bug fixes ‚Üí Patch version bump
   - `feat!:` or `BREAKING CHANGE:` ‚Üí Major version bump

#### Schema Change Workflow

```bash
# 1. Create and test migration locally
supabase migration new your_change_name
# Edit migration file...
npm run migrate
npm run generate-types

# 2. Test locally
npm test

# 3. Commit with proper conventional commit
npm run commit
# Choose appropriate type (feat/fix/feat! for breaking)

# 4. Create PR and wait for CI
git push origin feature/your-change

# 5. After PR merge ‚Üí Deploy runs ‚Üí Types automatically published!
```

#### Post-Deployment: NPM Package

After your schema changes are deployed:

1. **Automatic Publishing**: Types package is automatically published to NPM
2. **Version Bumping**: Version is automatically determined from commit messages
3. **GitHub Release**: Automatically created with change notes
4. **Team Notification**: Other teams can update their dependencies

```bash
# In other repositories (React Native apps, web dashboards)
npm update @everylanguage/shared-types
```

## üö® Troubleshooting CI Failures

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### ‚ùå Linting Failures

```bash
# Error: ESLint found issues
npm run lint:fix           # Auto-fix most issues
npm run lint               # Check remaining issues
```

#### ‚ùå Formatting Failures

```bash
# Error: Code not properly formatted
npm run format             # Fix formatting
npm run format:check       # Verify formatting
```

#### ‚ùå Type Check Failures

```bash
# Error: TypeScript compilation failed
npm run type-check         # See detailed errors
# Fix the TypeScript errors in your code
```

#### ‚ùå Test Failures

```bash
# Error: Tests failed
npm test                   # Run tests locally
npm test -- --verbose      # Get detailed output
npm test -- tests/specific-test.test.ts  # Run specific test
```

#### ‚ùå Outdated Types Error

```bash
# Error: Generated types are out of date
npm run generate-types     # Regenerate types
git add types/database.ts  # Commit updated types
git commit -m "fix: update database types"
```

#### ‚ùå Supabase Connection Issues

This usually indicates:

- Migration syntax error
- Invalid SQL in migration
- Database connection timeout

```bash
# Debug locally:
supabase start
supabase status
# Check logs for errors
```

#### ‚ùå NPM Publishing Failures

```bash
# Error: NPM package publishing failed

# Check if NPM_TOKEN secret is configured correctly
# Verify package name is available on NPM registry
# Ensure version isn't already published
```

**Common NPM Issues:**

1. **Permission denied**: Check NPM_TOKEN secret
2. **Package name taken**: Update package name in package.json
3. **Version already exists**: Workflow will auto-bump, but manual bumps might conflict
4. **Network timeout**: Re-run workflow

#### ‚ùå Types Out of Sync

```bash
# Error: Types don't match production schema

# Manually sync types:
npm run generate-types
git add types/database.ts
git commit -m "fix: sync types with production schema"
git push

# Or trigger manual publishing:
# Go to Actions ‚Üí Publish Types Package ‚Üí Run workflow
```

## üîê Secrets Management

### Required Secrets

Set these in GitHub repository settings (Settings ‚Üí Secrets and Variables ‚Üí Actions):

```bash
SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN=sbp_...     # Your Supabase access token
SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF=abcdef...    # Your production project reference
NPM_TOKEN=npm_...                 # Your NPM automation token
```

### How to Get These Values

1. **SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN**:

   - Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://app.supabase.com)
   - Click your profile ‚Üí Access Tokens
   - Create new token with appropriate permissions

2. **SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF**:

   - Go to your project settings
   - Copy the Project Reference ID

3. **NPM_TOKEN**:
   - Go to [NPM website](https://www.npmjs.com) and login
   - Click your profile ‚Üí Access Tokens
   - Generate new token with "Automation" type
   - Copy the token (starts with `npm_`)

### Local vs CI Environment

| Environment  | Local Development         | CI (GitHub Actions)        |
| ------------ | ------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Supabase URL | `http://127.0.0.1:54321`  | `http://127.0.0.1:54321`   |
| Database     | Local Docker instance     | Fresh Docker instance      |
| Secrets      | `.env.local` file         | GitHub Secrets             |
| Data         | Persistent during session | Ephemeral (reset each run) |

## üìä CI Status and Badges

### Understanding CI Status

| Status             | Meaning                   | Action Required           |
| ------------------ | ------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| ‚úÖ **Success**     | All checks passed         | Ready to merge            |
| ‚ùå **Failed**      | One or more checks failed | Fix issues and push       |
| üü° **In Progress** | CI is currently running   | Wait for completion       |
| ‚ö™ **Pending**     | Waiting to start          | Wait for available runner |

### PR Status Checks

Your PR must pass these checks before merging:

- ‚úÖ **lint-and-test** - All CI checks passed
- ‚úÖ **Code review** - Approved by team member
- ‚úÖ **Branch protection** - All requirements met

## üîÑ Advanced Workflows

### Manual Workflow Triggers

You can manually trigger workflows from GitHub:

1. Go to Actions tab
2. Select workflow (CI or Deploy)
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Choose branch and click "Run workflow"

### Workflow Debugging

View detailed logs:

1. Go to Actions tab
2. Click on the workflow run
3. Click on job name (e.g., "lint-and-test")
4. Expand individual steps to see logs

### Re-running Failed Jobs

If CI fails due to temporary issues:

1. Go to the failed workflow run
2. Click "Re-run failed jobs"
3. Or "Re-run all jobs" to run everything again

## üìà Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Run checks locally before pushing**

   ```bash
   npm run lint && npm run format:check && npm run type-check && npm test
   ```

2. **Keep PRs small and focused**

   - Easier to review
   - Faster CI runs
   - Easier to debug failures

3. **Write meaningful commit messages**

   - Use conventional commits
   - Include context about changes

4. **Test database changes thoroughly**
   - Test migrations up and down
   - Verify types are updated
   - Test with realistic data

### For Teams

1. **Don't skip CI checks**

   - Never merge if CI is failing
   - Investigate failures promptly

2. **Review CI logs for failures**

   - Understand what went wrong
   - Learn from common issues

3. **Keep dependencies updated**
   - Regular npm audit
   - Update GitHub Actions versions

## üÜò Getting Help

### When CI Fails

1. **Check the logs** in GitHub Actions
2. **Reproduce locally** using the same commands
3. **Ask team members** if you're stuck
4. **Create an issue** if it's a recurring problem
